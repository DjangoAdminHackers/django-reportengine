ReportEngine (for Django 1.1+)

Inspired by vitalik's django-reporting, ReportEngine seeks to make something less tied to the ORM to allow for those many instances where complex reports require some direct sql, or pure python code.

Also another goal is making it possible to expose reports in various formats (e.g. xml, csv).
